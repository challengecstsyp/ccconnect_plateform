As a result, the answer scores at the bottom of all evaluation criteria. For a mid‑level position, interviewers expect candidates to articulate the three core elements—typically clarity/specificity, timeliness, and a balanced, behavior‑focused approach (or similar frameworks such as consistency, objectivity, and developmental focus). To improve, you should study common models of effective feedback, practice summarizing them concisely, and present your answer in a structured format (e.g., list each element with a brief explanation). Demonstrating this knowledge will show the analytical and communication skills expected for the role.",
