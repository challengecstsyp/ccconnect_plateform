        "feedback": "The submitted answer (\"sad\") does not address the interview question at all. It offers no information about the purpose of the `key` prop, its role in helping React identify elements during reconciliation, or how it impacts rendering performance and UI stability. For a junior React developer position, you are expected to at least explain that keys give each element a stable identity, enable efficient diffing, and should be unique and stable (e.g., using IDs rather than array indices). In future responses, make sure to read the question carefully, provide a clear and complete explanation, and organize your answer in a readable format (paragraphs or bullet points). Demonstrating even a basic understanding of this core React concept is essential for progressing in the interview process.",
